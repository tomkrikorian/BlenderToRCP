"""The validator is the single capability authority.

`validate` and the export-time warning pass each kept their own list of which
Blender node types are supported. The extractor's copy had drifted 14 entries
behind, so TEX_NOISE, CLAMP, MAP_RANGE, REROUTE and others exported correctly
while being reported as "unrecognized; export may differ" - and INVERT as
"requires baking" - directly contradicting what `validate` had just said about
the same material.

Measured before the fix: a plain Value -> Clamp -> Roughness graph exported
successfully and emitted
"Material 'M': Node 'Clamp' (CLAMP) is unrecognized; export may differ."
