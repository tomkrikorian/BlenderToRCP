### [Nodes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/unpremultiply#Nodes)

[`Premultiply`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/premultiply)

Multiplies the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.

[`Additive Mix`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/additive-mix)

Adds foreground and background values.

[`Subtractive Mix`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/subtractive-mix)

Subtracts foreground from background values.

[`Difference`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/difference)

Outputs the distance between foreground and background values.

[`Burn`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/burn)

A blend operation that darkens the foreground layer using the background.

[`Dodge`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/dodge)

A blend operation that lightens the background layer depending on the foreground.

[`Screen`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/screen)

A blend operation that lightens areas that are darker than white.

[`Overlay`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/overlay)

A blend operation that multiplies dark areas and screens light areas.

[`Disjoint Over`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/disjoint-over)

A merge operation that layers foreground over background color, but assumes no overlap in partially transparent areas covered by both.

[`In`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/in)

Outputs areas of foreground that overlap with the alpha of background.

[`Mask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/mask)

Outputs areas of background that overlap with the alpha of foreground.

[`Matte`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/matte)

A merge operation that layers premultiplied foreground over background.

[`Out`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/out)

Outputs areas of foreground that do not overlap with background.

[`Over`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/over)

A merge operation that layers foreground over background, using the alpha of the foreground.

[`Inside`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/inside)

Multiplies a mask to all channels of the input.
