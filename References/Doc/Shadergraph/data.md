# Data

Convert data values to different formats, or manipulate individual elements within a data structure.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data#overview)

Use data nodes to take one type of data and manipulate it to get a different type of value. Data manipulations can take several forms:

* Convert one data type to a different format.
* Combine individual elements to create a single data type.
* Separate a single data type into its component elements.
* Extract or manipulate individual values from a data structure and use them as input to other nodes.

### [Nodes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data#Nodes)

[`Convert`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/convert)

Converts a stream from one data type to another.

[`Swizzle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/swizzle)

Performs an arbitrary permutation of the channels of the input stream, returning a new stream of the specified type.

[`Combine 2`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/combine-2)

Combines the channels from two streams into two channels of a single output stream of a compatible type.

[`Combine 3`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/combine-3)

Combines the channels from three streams into three channels of a single output stream of a compatible type.

[`Combine 4`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/combine-4)

Combines the channels from four streams into four channels of a single output stream of a compatible type.

[`Extract`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/extract)

Generates a float stream from one channel of a color​N o​r vector​N ​stream.

[`Separate 2`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/separate-2)

Outputs each of the channels of a vector2 or integer2 as individual float or integer outputs.

[`Separate 3`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/separate-3)

Outputs each of the channels of a color3, vector3, or integer3 as individual float or integer outputs.

[`Separate 4`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/separate-4)

Outputs each of the channels of a color4, vector4, or integer4 as individual float or integer outputs.

[`Primvar Reader`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/primvar-reader)

A node that provides the ability for shading networks to consume data defined on geometry.
