## [Parameter description](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-procedural/worley-noise-2d#Parameter-description)

`Texture Coordinates`
:   The 2D coordinate at which the data is read for mapping a texture to a surface. The default uses the current UV coordinates, in which U is the horizontal axis and V is the vertical axis.

`Jitter`
:   The amount to *jitter* or shift the center of each cell experiences. The default value is `1.0`. A smaller value creates a more regular pattern, and `0` creates perfect squares.

The `Worley Noise 2D` node procedurally generates nonuniform cellular regions. Creates a finite number of center points, and each region is a polygon that surrounds the points closest to each center point. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the `Worley Noise 2D` node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally:

Multiply the incoming texture coordinates with a constant float, which changes the frequency of the generated noise. A higher value corresponds to the pattern repeating more often. You then run the output through a convert node to change it to a black and white color value.
