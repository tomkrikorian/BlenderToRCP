## [Parameter descriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/swizzle#Parameter-descriptions)

`In`
:   The input value.

`Channels`
:   A string of `1-4` characters that determine the permutation to perform. These characters can be “r”, “g”, “b”, or “a” if the `In` parameter is a color input, or “x”, “y”, “z”, or “w” for vector inputs. Use “r” or “x” if the input is a float.

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/data/swizzle#Discussion)

The `Swizzle` node determines its output by first looking at the `Channels` parameter. Each character in the `Channel` string represents one of the channels of the `In` parameter. For example, if you pass in a vector3 of `(1, 5, 10)` as the `In` parameter, “x” refers to `1`, `y` to `5`, and `z` to `10`. The order of the characters determines how the channels of the input switch around to create the output. For the previous example, if the `Channels` parameter is “zzz”, the output is `(10, 10, 10)`.

Note

The character length of `Channels` must be equal to the number of channels in the output.

The table below shows additional examples of the swizzle node process:

| In | Channels | Out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vector3: (1, 5, 10) | zzz | Vector3: (10, 10, 10) |
| Vector3: (1, 5, 10) | zyx | Vector3: (10, 5, 1) |
| Vector2: (5, 0) | xxy | Vector3: (5, 5, 0) |
| Vector3: (1, 5, 10) | zx | Vector2: (10, 1) |
| Color3: (0.5, 0.8, 0) | grb | Color3: (0.8, 0.5, 0) |
