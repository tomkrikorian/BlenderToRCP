# Cellular Noise 3D

A 3D cellular noise generator.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 26.0+visionOS 1.0+

## [Parameter Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/3d-procedural/cellular-noise-3d#Parameter-Types)

| Input | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `Position` | Vector3f |

| Output | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `Out` | Float |

## [Parameter descriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/3d-procedural/cellular-noise-3d#Parameter-descriptions)

`Position`
:   The 3D coordinates at which the data is read in order to map the texture onto a surface. The default is to use the current 3D object-space coordinates.

The `Cellular Noise 3D` shader node procedurally generates noise patterns that you can use to add texture and variation to materials. Because this node generates noise in 3D, the texture doesn’t repeat in the Z direction, but rather continue as depth changes. Below is an example of a node graph that uses the `Cellular Noise 3D` node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally:

Multiply the incoming position with a constant float. The float changes the frequency of the generated noise to a higher number that corresponds with the pattern repeating more often. The output of the node runs through a `Convert` node to change the float output to a black and white color output. Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube:
