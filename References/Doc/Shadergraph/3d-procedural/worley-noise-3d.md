## [Parameter descriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/3d-procedural/worley-noise-3d#Parameter-descriptions)

`Position`
:   The 3D coordinates at which the node reads the data for mapping a texture to a surface. The default uses the current 3D object-space coordinates.

`Jitter`
:   The amount of *jitter* or shift the center of each cell experiences. The default value is `1.0`. A smaller value creates a more regular pattern, and `0` creates perfect squares.

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/3d-procedural/worley-noise-3d#Discussion)

The `Worley Noise 3D` node procedurally generates nonuniform cellular regions. The node creates a finite number of center points, and each region is a polygon that surrounds the points closest to each center point. Because this node generates noise in 3D, the texture doesn’t repeat in the Z direction but rather continues as depth changes. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the `Worley Noise 3D` node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally:

Multiply the incoming texture coordinates with a constant float, which changes the frequency of the generated noise. A higher value corresponds to the pattern repeating more often. Then run the output through a convert node to change it to a black and white color value.
Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube:
