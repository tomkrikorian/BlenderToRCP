| `St` | Vector2f |
| `Wrap S` | String |
| `Wrap T` | String |

| Output | Type |

## [Parameter descriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/uv-texture#Parameter-descriptions)

Bias
:   The bias the node applies to all components of the texture. The node adds this parameter to the texture after multiplying it by the scale.

Fallback
:   The value to use if the texture can’t be read from the file.

File
:   The image file to use for the texture.

Scale
:   The scale the node applies to all components of the texture. The node multiplies the texture value by this parameter.

St
:   The 2D coordinate at which the data is read for mapping the texture onto a surface. This node maps from `st` to `uv` image space. The `(0,0)` coordinate in `st` image space maps to the `(0,0)` coordinate in the `uv` space which represents the lower-left–hand corner. The `(1,1)` coordinate in `st` image space maps to the `(1,1)` coordinate in `uv` space which represents the upper-right–hand corner.

Wrap S
:   The way that the node handles `S` values outside of the range of `0-1`.

Wrap T
:   The way that the node handles `T` values outside of the range of `0-1`.

## [Output descriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/uv-texture#Output-descriptions)

RGBA
:   The `Color4` output of the texture that contains a red, green, blue, and alpha component.

RGB
:   The standard `Color3` output of the texture that contains a red, green, and blue component.

Read
:   Only the red component of the texture.

Green
:   Only the green component of the texture.

Blue
:   Only the blue component of the texture.

Alpha
:   Only the alpha component of the texture.

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/uv-texture#Discussion)

The `Wrap` parameters for the node tell the node how to handle `S` and `T` values outside of the normal range of `0-1`. These inputs take one of four values to determine their behavior.

* black: Texture coordinates outside the normal range return black.
* clamp: Texture coordinates outside the normal range clamp to the normal range. Any values greater than `1` are set to `1`, and any values less than `0` are set to `0`
* periodic: Texture coordinates outside the normal range are normalized into a range of `0-1`, tiling the image. This is effectively equivalent to applying modulo 1 to the coordinates.

### [Nodes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/uv-texture#Nodes)

[`Image`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/image)

A texture referencing a 2D image file.

[`Tiled Image`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/tiled-image)

Samples data from an image with provisions for offsetting and tiling in UV space.

[`Transform 2D`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/transform-2d)

A node that applies an affine transformation to a 2d input.
