ShaderGraph Node

# Transform 2D

A node that applies an affine transformation to a 2d input.

iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 26.0+visionOS 1.0+

## [Parameter Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/transform-2d#Parameter-Types)

| Input | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `In` | Vector2f |
| `Rotation` | Float |
| `Scale` | Vector2f |
| `Translation` | Vector2f |

| Output | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `Out` | Vector2f |

## [Parameter descriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/transform-2d#Parameter-descriptions)

`In`
:   The vector to transform. This node appends an addtional component onto the `In` vector with a value of `1.0` to make the vector match the dimensions of the `Mat` matrix. When transformation is complete, this additional component clears.

`Rotation`
:   The degrees of counter-clockwise rotation to apply to the input.

`Scale`
:   The scale to apply to the input. This parameter stretches the input by the given magnitude.

`Translation`
:   The translation to apply to the input. A translation moves the input in the given directions.

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture/transform-2d#Discussion)

The `Transform 2D` node takes a 2D vector as an input, applies the given rotation, scale, and translation, then outputs the transformed vector.
