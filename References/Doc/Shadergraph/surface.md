# Surface

Generate a MaterialX preview surface.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/surface#overview)

Every new material you create includes a preview surface that displays your material as you build it. Create additional surfaces to see alternate previews within the same graph.

### [Nodes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/surface#Nodes)

[`Preview Surface`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/surface/preview-surface)

A MaterialX version of USD Preview Surface.

### [Node Categories](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shadergraph/surface#Node-Categories)
