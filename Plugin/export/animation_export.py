"""
Animation export preparation for BlenderToRCP.

Concatenates compatible actions into a single sequential timeline and bakes
each target independently to improve compatibility with Reality Composer Pro.

Blender 5.2 Actions are layered and can contain multiple slots.  A slot is the
ownership boundary: an Action that has an ``OBCharacter`` slot must never be
broadcast to every object merely because they all have ``id_type == OBJECT``.
This module therefore builds one global clip timeline, but applies only the
``(Action, ActionSlot)`` bindings that belong to each target.
